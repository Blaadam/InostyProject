# InostyProject

Inosty was a web application designed for project management that incorporated features from Trello and other similar solutions.

The web application is incomplete, only providing enough baseline functionality to meet the course requirements. Users can:

1. Register Accounts
2. Login Accounts
3. Logout
4. Create Workspaces
5. Remove Workspace Members
6. Sort Workspace Members (uses a QuickSort implementation)
7. Open Boards
8. Add/Remove Lists

The application follows industry-standard practices of protecting user credentials through hashing the password and storing the respective salt so the password cannot be used if there was a breach.

## Prerequisits

1. Visual Studio 2022
   - ASP.NET and Web Development
   - .NET Framework project and item templates
   - LINQ to SQL Tools
2. Microsoft SQL Server
